### üîÑ From Marketing to Data

After 10 years working in marketing - building social campaigns, evaluating pages (and pages) of analytics and creating digital content ‚Äî I realised it was always the **data** that interested me most. What are the patterns? What do the numbers mean? What works and what doesn't?

As a millennial who spent most of my teens on Bebo and MySpace - arguably the greatest social networks of my time - it‚Äôs no surprise I ended up working in the online space. I was customising my Tumblr and Blogspot with HTML and CSS before I really knew what they were, unknowingly laying the foundations for a future in data.

I'm currently enrolled on the **[CFGDegree in Data Science](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/cfgdegree/)** ‚Äî an intensive 16-week bootcamp covering core tools and concepts to deepen my knowledge and pivot into the data space.
